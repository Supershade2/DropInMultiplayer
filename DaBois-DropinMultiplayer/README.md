# DropinMultiplayer
The drop in multiplayer mod for Risk of Rain 2, now updated for the 1.0 update!
This mod allows the host to have players join mid-game, and automatically gives them items to help them catch up!

If you have any bug reports, ping me on the modding discord (https://discord.gg/MfQtGYj), you can make an issue on the github if you want, but I'll level with you, I'll probably forget to check it.

I updated this mod from the original https://thunderstore.io/package/SushiDev/DropinMultiplayer/ mod as it has not been updated for 1.0. If the original mod creator, or anyone else who is better at modding than I am, is putting up a better version of this mod let me know and I'll depricate. 


### Commands Examples
  1. join_as Commando = Spawns you in as commando.
  2. join_as Huntress niwith = Spawns niwith in as Huntress, replace niwith with whoever you'd like to turn into huntress/whatever in the names list .
